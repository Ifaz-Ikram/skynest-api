## 🎯 Issue Resolved

**Problem:** Tailwind CSS v4 configuration errors with `@apply` directives

**Solution:** 
- Converted all Tailwind utilities to pure CSS
- Used Tailwind v4's new `@theme` directive for custom properties
- Replaced `@apply` with standard CSS classes
- Fixed PostCSS configuration to use `@tailwindcss/postcss`

---

## ✅ What's Working Now

1. **Vite Dev Server** - Running smoothly on port 5173
2. **Tailwind CSS v4** - Properly configured with PostCSS
3. **Custom Styling** - All luxury hotel design styles active
4. **React App** - App.jsx loaded and ready
5. **API Integration** - Connected to backend on port 4000
