## 🧪 Quick Test

### Test Manager Cannot Create Another Manager:

```powershell
# Login as Manager
$managerResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
  -Uri "http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login" `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body (@{username="manager1"; password="password123"} | ConvertTo-Json)

# Try to create another manager (Should FAIL)
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
  -Uri "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/employees" `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Headers @{Authorization = "Bearer $($managerResponse.token)"} `
  -Body (@{
    username = "manager2"
    password = "password123"
    role = "Manager"
    full_name = "Manager Two"
    email = "manager2@skynest.com"
  } | ConvertTo-Json)
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "You don't have permission to create Manager accounts",
  "currentRole": "Manager",
  "attemptedRole": "Manager"
}
```

### Test Manager CAN Create Receptionist:

```powershell
# Create receptionist (Should SUCCEED)
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
  -Uri "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/employees" `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Headers @{Authorization = "Bearer $($managerResponse.token)"} `
  -Body (@{
    username = "receptionist1"
    password = "password123"
    role = "Receptionist"
    full_name = "Receptionist One"
    email = "receptionist1@skynest.com"
  } | ConvertTo-Json)
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Receptionist account created successfully",
  "user": {
    "user_id": 3,
    "username": "receptionist1",
    "role": "Receptionist",
    "guest_id": 3,
    "full_name": "Receptionist One"
  }
}
```

### Check Allowed Roles as Manager:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get `
  -Uri "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/allowed-roles" `
  -Headers @{Authorization = "Bearer $($managerResponse.token)"}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "currentRole": "Manager",
  "allowedRoles": ["Receptionist", "Accountant"]
}
```

Note: "Manager" is **NOT** in the allowed roles list ✅
